A Telegram client for Samsung watches, written in C# and Xamarin.

Join the announcement channel - [@telewear](https://t.me/telewear).

## What stage is it on currently?
Currently it's a very early alpha. We need to make a lot more stuff to make it considered beta- or even alpha-quality.

## How can I help?
You can help us by adding something from the [to-do](https://github.com/telewear/telewear/projects/1) list.

This app uses Visual Studio 2019 with the Xamarin workload and Visual Studio Tools for Tizen.

### Please note:
You need to replace the API keys with [your own keys](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id).

If you fork Telewear you must provide the source code of your forked app as per the GPL.
