Join the announcement channel - [@telewear](https://t.me/telewear).

## What stage is it on currently?
Currently it's a very early alpha. We need to make a lot more stuff to make it considered beta- or even alpha-quality.

## How can I help?
You can help us by adding something from the [project to-do](https://github.com/telewear/telewear/projects/1) list.

This project uses Visual Studio 2019 with the Xamarin workload.

### Please note:
You need to replace the API keys with [your own keys](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id).

You must provide the source code of your app as per the GPL.

And, you can't use the Telewear name or icon, nor can you imply affiliation with Telewear.
