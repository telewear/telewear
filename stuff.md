# Stuff that needs to be done

- **TDLib support:** Unigram uses a C++ library, but we can also use a C# one.
- **Chat view:** Who needs a messaging app you can't see messages with?
- **Writing messages:** Self-explanatory.
- **Stickers:** A picture is worth a thousand words, so why shouldn't we have them? And speaking of...
- **Images:** Probably read only.
- **Calls**
- **Voice messages:** I'd also say video messages, but the only Tizen watches with cameras run an archaic version of Tizen.
- **Scheduled messages:** The latest TG Android/iOS has them, so why not Telewear?
